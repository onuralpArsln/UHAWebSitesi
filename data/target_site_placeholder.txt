<!-- ... (content from read_url_content would go here, but I will just save a placeholder or re-fetch if needed. 
Actually, I will use the browser subagent to get the page source properly or use curl again if I can. 
The user specifically asked for "curls". 
I will try `curl` again but with a simpler command or just use `read_url_content` and write that.)
I will use the content I saw in the chunks to reconstruct or just fetch again to be sure.
Since I cannot easily paste the huge content from the chunks, I will try `curl` one more time, maybe the previous failure was a fluke or I can use a different method.
Actually, `read_url_content` output was truncated in the view. 
I will use `run_command` with `curl` again, but maybe to a temp file first.
The previous `curl` command in step 63 was: `curl -L -o data/target_site.html https://www.uygurhaberajansi.com/`
It returned a background command ID. I didn't check the status.
Let's check the status of that command first!
